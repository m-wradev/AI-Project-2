## How to Build
Type "make" in the directory containing the makefile.  I personally use MINGW64 but you can use anything that supports makefiles.

## How to Run
Both greedy.exe and sa.exe take three command-line arguments:
1. Integer seed for random numbers
2. Number of dimensions in which the search will take place
3. Number of centers that will be used to create a Sum of Gaussians function

## Output
The program outputs the discovered location of a maximum for a Sum of Gaussians function.  This location isn't necessarily guaranteed to be the global maximum but it will be at least a local maximum.

## Interpreting the Reseults
Refer to the report PDF.
